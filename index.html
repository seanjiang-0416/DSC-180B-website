        <h1>Evidence-Based Generative AI for Complex Political Misinformation Detection</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In an era marked by the rapid dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, the
            need for effective fact-checking methodologies has never been more pressing. Traditional
            fact-checking approaches, while valuable, suffer from limitations such as time-consuming
            manual processes and lack of contextual explanation for classifications. This paper proposes
            a novel approach to fact-checking by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) within
            a multi-model pipeline to provide both veracity labels and informative explanations for
            claims. Building upon previous research, we integrate various predictive AI models and
            external evidence from reliable sources to enhance the contextuality and accuracy of our
            predictions.</p>
