                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">It was once said that "a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth
                        has a
                        chance to get its pants on." This is more true today than ever, as misinformation and
                        disinformation are becoming increasingly pervasive and destructive, and have permanently altered
                        the political landscape. Fact check sites such as PolitiFact and Snopes have led the charge in
                        combating this misinformation thus far, but they are limited due to the simple fact that it
                        takes more time to fact check claims than it does to spread misinformation.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">As a result, the need for effective automated fact-checking methodologies
                        has never
                        been more pressing. Traditional automated fact-checking approaches, while valuable, fall short
                        when it comes to providing justification and context for their classifications. We propose a
                        novel approach to fact-checking which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) within a
                        multi-model pipeline to provide both veracity labels and informative explanations for claims.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">Our approach is a 3-stage pipeline which uses an ensemble of predictive
                        models and a
                        LLM (Google's Gemini PRO 1.0) augmented by an evidence retrieval module.

                            of different factors (such as sentiment, predicted political bias, etc.) to offer the LLM

                        <li class="m-5 text-lg">Evidence retrieval: We conduct a nearest-neighbors search across a
                            knowledge
                            database built from news articles from reliable sources to retrieve sentences with high
                            semantic similarity to the input claim. We also conduct a separate semantic search across a
                            database of previously fact-checked claims to find semantically similar claims and their
                            fact-check rating.

                        <li class="m-5 text-lg">LLM: The claim, the results from predictive models, and the set of
                            evidence (news excerpts and previous claims) are passed into LLM, which generates a

                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">We evaluated a number of different implementations of the pipeline, with
                        slight
                        differences in the factors we included in each. To avoid evaluating it on data that could be
                        found within the database of previous fact-checks, we only evaluated it on claims made in 2022
                        and later.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">Below are relevant results from our trials:

                    <img class="mt-5" src="./figure/trials_table_cropped.png" alt="Trials Table Image">
                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">Our final model was one which used the retrieved evidence/fact-checks, and
                        involved
                        a very detailed prompt. We re-ran the trial multiple times and saw that Gemini's responses tend
                        to vary quite a bit between trials, even for identical prompts. As a result, there was quite a
                        bit of variance in the performance of the pipeline, and its accuracy ranged from 53% to 30% on
                        the six-way classification task.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mt-10 text-lg">Below is the accuracy according to each label, taken from our best test
                        run:</p>

                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">We can see that the pipeline was quite good at classifying claims of certain
                        labels,
                        namely "mostly-true" and "pants-on-fire" claims. The fact that it performs well on
                        "pants-on-fire" claims is encouraging, since this means it's able to successfully identify
                        deliberate attempts to misinform over 80% of the time. We also see that it performs abysmally on
                        some labels (barely-true), but when we take a look at the distribution of predictions (split by
                        the true label), the result is somewhat encouraging.
                    </p>
                    <img class="mt-5" src="./figure/preds_dist_53.png" alt="Prediction Distribution Image">
                    <p class="mt-5 text-lg">As we can see, the model has trouble distinguishing between "nearby" labels.
                        For
                        example, it predicted "half-true" over 80% of the time for claims which were "barely-true". This
                        is an understandable mistake due to the fact that these labels are adjacent, and even to humans,
                        the difference between them is somewhat subjective. It also tended to be overzealous when it
                        came to rating claims as "pants-on-fire", as it gave this label to nearly 60% of claims that
                        should've simply been “false”. With this in mind, the result isn't as bad as it seems at first
                        glance, but the low overall accuracy and extreme variation between responses across trials does
                        indicate that the model requires some tuning before it could be used in a reliable fact-check
                        pipeline.
